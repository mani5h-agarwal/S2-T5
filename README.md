## Abstract

  ### Motivation
  
  > 
In today’s fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is challenging, particularly due
to the high cost of advanced fitness technology. ChronoFit helps in solving this problem by
contributing to foster a healthier, more active lifestyle in a practical and accessible manner for
college students and beyond.



 ### Problem Statement

  >
The ChronoFit project aims to develop a digital stopwatch that not only functions as a conventional lap timer but also provides fitness insights such as calorie count, heart rate estimates,
and stamina tracking—all without the use of physical sensors. By utilizing average data and
user inputs (such as weight, distance covered, age, and type of activity), ChronoFit will deliver
a unique, sensor-free approach to fitness monitoring.


### Features


•  **Implementing Stopwatch with Lap Timer**:</t>   
  > Standard stopwatch functionality to track time. Ability to record and display multiple lap times.

• **Calorie Calculation**:
  > Estimates calories burned based on user inputs (weight, age, type of activity) using established formulas.
 
• **Heart Rate Estimation**:
  > Calculates estimated heart rate based on age and activity level using standard equations.

• **Stamina Tracking**:
  > Evaluates stamina based on duration of activity and estimated calories burned
